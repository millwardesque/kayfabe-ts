# TODO in index.ts

- Parsing
- Pre-processing defined actions and actors so we know they exist
- Proper filepath resolution
- More descriptive error message w/ file name and actual code line
- Add column and length fields to Token
- no-op keyword (like 'pass'?)
- Consistently spaced indents
- Restore sequences
